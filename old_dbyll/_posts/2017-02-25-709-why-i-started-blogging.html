<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has been 3 years (I think) since my boss started urging me to blog, but at that time I didn’t know what I wanted to focus on. I wanted to write but I was not confident enough to write about something, I didn’t have a direction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Last year, I found a path (Technical Leadership / Pursuit of Quality and Productive Work), I learned many things along that path and I often shared them to others. But then I found myself repeating the same stories over and over again, sometimes I miss something out, sometimes I add something new, and sometimes there are conflicting ideas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And then I found this randomly at a bookstore while looking for something else. It made me realize lots of things which included the motivation to really write more.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://github.com/markanthonyrosario/markanthonyrosario.github.io/raw/master/assets/postimages/austin_keon_steal_like_an_artist.png" alt="austin_kleon_steal_like_an_artist"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f642.png" alt="slightly_smiling_face"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I would like to recommend this book to everyone and hope that It can inspire you the same way it has inspired me. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://github.com/markanthonyrosario/markanthonyrosario.github.io/raw/master/assets/postimages/austin_kleon_write_the_book_you_want_to_read.png" alt="Write the book you want to read"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>*a page from the book *photo from: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/deathtogutenberg/albums/72157629454918267">https://www.flickr.com/photos/deathtogutenberg/albums/72157629454918267</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
