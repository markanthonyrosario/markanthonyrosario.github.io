<!-- <insert the circle-of-concern-vs-circle-of-influence-here> -->
Do not blame other people your your lack of growth.

Take it upon yourself to manage your career.

"Think like a Manager, Act like a leader", stop the [Employee Mindset](https://ideavisionaction.com/entrepreneurship/entrepreneurs-beware-of-the-employee-mindset/)


> Train your people to be better than you

This is the only true way to scale your operations.

Beware of the [Scarcity Mindset](http://franklincoveystephenpearson.blogspot.com/2011/01/abundance-mentality-vs-scarcity.html)

these thoughts are just 2 of the many ideas i have learned from Chapter1:Proactivity [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits.html)

I highly recommend that you people read it to improve both their work and personal life.
