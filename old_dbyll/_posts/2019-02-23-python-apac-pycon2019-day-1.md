In this age of Google, you will still wonder why people flock to tech meetups.
There's just still this feeling of bias/confidence towards tools/tech that you can only get after meeting real people who used them in real life.

(there are more things id like to say here but hopefully i find time to update this post.)


And as always I am happy to be in the presence of people doing productive stuff using technology.

I'd like to thank my current company Salarium for sending me to Pycon :)
