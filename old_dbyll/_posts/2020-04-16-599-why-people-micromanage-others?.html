(assuming our goals are S.M.A.R.T.)  that measure how close you are to reaching the desired state of your project.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This eliminates the fear of failure and makes our teammates more happy. And it has been mentioned over and over that happy workers are more productive workers (maybe this stems back to Maslow's Pyramid of Human Needs, so as long as physiological needs are met with proper salary, relationship/acceptance needs are met by not being an ass micromanager, people reach the top of the pyramid, which in turn means more productivity for your team).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
