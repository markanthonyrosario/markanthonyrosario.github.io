Quote from the site
> This is not a long-winded theoretical blathering that you see all too often; instead, we actually start
writing OO code very quickly. I believe that this ‘hands-on’ style of learning, makes understanding OO (object oriented)
PHP much easier… and less boring too!

im keeping this as a bookmark as this site (killerphp.com) really helped me when i was handed with OOP PHP codes back when i did not know OOP.
