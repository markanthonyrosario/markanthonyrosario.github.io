<!-- wp:paragraph -->  <p>if you want to improve your impact at work and your salary, strive to be a decision maker.<br><br>If you are a tech-guy, and a good one at that, it means you get to decide within the team what tools to use and how to implement them.<br>If you are not aware of it, it is your ability to pick a road and decide is what you are being paid for, not your ability to use a tool or a language.<br><br>If you want to explore the business, managerial side (coming from a programming background) then you must be able to provide decisions<br>relating to "How you can improve the business using programming/automation".<br><br>Look at CEOs and other C officials, they don't do grunt work, they are there to think and decide about major things.<br>Those who get promoted, are chosen because their superiors can trust them to make smaller decisions for them.<br><br>Everyone want's a higher salary, we should work to get there and be genuinely valuable.</p>  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->    <!-- wp:heading -->  <h2>How do I Improve my decision-making?</h2>  <!-- /wp:heading -->    <!-- wp:paragraph -->  <p>First, master your craft, you can't make sound decisions if you are just guessing and don't know your work by heart.</p>  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->    <!-- wp:paragraph -->  <p>Second, learn how to gather relevant metrics for your work and your goals so you can make data-driven decisions instead of <br>just drafting conclusions out of thin air or gut feeling.</p>  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->    <!-- wp:heading -->  <h2>If I'm already a decision-maker what do I do next?</h2>  <!-- /wp:heading -->    <!-- wp:paragraph -->  <p>chances are you have subordinates at this point, teach them the science you use to make decisions.<br>So they can grow and learn how to make small decisions for you.<br>So you can move on and think about higher level problems and hopefully get to be making decisions on the higher levels of the organization.<br>By doing this, you don't only lift yourself up but also your subordinates.<br></p>  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
