[Me on LinkedIn](https://ph.linkedin.com/in/mark-anthony-rosario?trk=profile-badge)

I enjoy providing tech solutions to organizations where…

* developers, operations and product designers work together as partners rather than treating each other as just “workers” or “resources”
* learning is highly valued
* Quality and Efficiency is being pursued.
* truth is shared and prevents from people being treated as mushrooms (see mushroom management)

I believe that

* life is short, so i dont like people not saying what they really meant.
* making it easy for people to do the right things


I'm a web developer and like typical web developers  (atleast those that i know) I…

* am interested in updates in technology
* have interest in photography (although i already sold my gears now)
* love playing games (PC/console)
* jump from one interest to another, like one day im building model kits then next day im building nature aquariums
* procrastinate sometimes
* have arguments with other devs, and a certain section of this blog will be for sharing things that i learned on how other organizations make it work.

I started this blog
* to compile my inspirations, findings and thoughts
hoping that one day I could connect all of my thoughts
* with no initial intent to write lots of new content, but would just link similar articles together
