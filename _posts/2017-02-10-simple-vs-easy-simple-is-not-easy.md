[Rich Hickey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure) emphasizes simplicity’s virtues over easiness’,
showing that while many choose easiness they may end up with complexity,
and the better way is to choose easiness along the simplicity path.

*  simple is not easy, 
*  it takes effort to simplify things, 
*  it is easy to make complex things, 
*  it takes skill to simplify them, 
*  it is not about how many tools you know, it is about simplifying the way they connect to each other and how your users use them.
*  we should aim to reach efficiency by simplicity
