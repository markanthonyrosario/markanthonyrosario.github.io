> There are lots of Humans involved in Software Development.

In this age of Google, you will still wonder why people flock to tech meetups.
There's just still this feeling of bias/confidence towards tools/tech that you can only get after meeting real people who used them in real life.

(there are more things id like to say here but hopefully i find time to update this post.)


And as always I am happy to be in the presence of people doing productive stuff using technology.

I'd like to thank my current company Salarium for sending me to Pycon :)
