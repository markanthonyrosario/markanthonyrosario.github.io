The good companies who support growth and development will take you in, just be honest.<br></p>  <!-- /divi:paragraph -->    <!-- divi:heading -->  <h2>Focus on your goal</h2>  <!-- /divi:heading -->    <!-- divi:paragraph -->  <p>don't get stuck, don't get blocked, allowing yourself to be blocked from your personal goals by your current job is a surefire to kill motivation and evolve to be that reactive-always-complaining employee.
