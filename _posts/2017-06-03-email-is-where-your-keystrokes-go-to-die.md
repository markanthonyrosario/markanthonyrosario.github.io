# Email is where your keystrokes go to die
> never write a long EMAIL to someone three or four sentences, anything longer than that should be on a blog or a wiki or in your product’s documentation or it should be on a FAQ or a knowledge base or anywhere in the world except email. Because email is where your keystrokes do to die.
