description: what i want to say to my non-blogging self from years ago
---

It has been 3 years (I think) since my boss started urging me to blog, but at that time I didnâ€™t know what I wanted to focus on.  I wanted to write but I was not confident enough to write about something, I didnâ€™t have a direction.

Last year, I found a path (Technical Leadership / Pursuit of Quality and Productive Work), I learned many things along that path and I often shared them to others. But then I found myself repeating the same stories over and over again, sometimes I miss something out, sometimes I add something new, and  sometimes there are conflicting ideas.

And then I found this randomly at a bookstore while looking for something else.
It made me realize lots of things which included the motivation to really write more.
