> You're The Average Of The Five People You Spend The Most Time With

Yesterday (Jan 12, 2019) I attended the [Ansible Users Group\'s First meetup for 2019](https://www.facebook.com/events/2275325182742020/)

We had a short Intro by sir Michael Calizo (Principal Technical Account Manager at Red Hat) about Ansible

I frequently attend meetups like this to learn new stuff (regardless if i can use it immediately at work, it will be useful down the road)
and to meet new cool and outgoing people and learn how they do things within their own organizations. 
They also have some swags too :)
