# The Self-Organizing Team
> P = p - i

* `DOES` self organize around the challenges/boundaries/constraints put in place by management

# Management
* `DOES` guide the evolution of the behaviours that emerge from the interaction of indenpendent agents
* `DOES NOT` specify in advance what effective behaviour is.
* but `DOES` know what effective behaviour is and lets the team realize it themselves
* `DOES` choose what product to build and who builds them.
* `DOES` come up with appropriate challenges and remove impediments (P=p-i)
* `DOES NOT` micromanage, does not say how to solve the challenges. (to allow self-organization to grow)
* `DOES` aim to reduce the constraints/constrols whenever possible (as the self-organization grows)
