> Management is essentially moving the fulcrum over, and the key to effective management is delegation - Stephen Covey, (Habit 3) Seven Habits of Highly Effective People

## Where Micromanagement Does work
* it works for `E` people (see [Alderfer's ERG theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERG_theory)), 
* routine people who LIKE being told what to do
  * because they dont have to think, so they can think about something else.
  * like students or those busy with other big things
  * for people like them, routine is a breather.

## Where Micromanagement Doesn't work
* it does not work for `G` people (see [Alderfer's ERG theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERG_theory))
* if u are a `G` person.even you won't enjoy being micromanaged (but subconciously we tend to do it to others)

## How do you increase output with `G` people?
the key is `delegation`

proper task delegation have the ff: characteristics (much like a task delegation guidelines)
* `Desired Results` 
  * what need's to be done, NOT how to do it. 
  * most of us fail here, we fail to share the output so we end up not trusting the other party so we dive into telling them exactly how to act. 
    * this hurts `Autonomy` [(one of the 3 factors behind motivation according to Dan Pink's "Drive")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us)
* `Guidelines` 
  * the rules of engagement
  * safety notes on what we SHOULD NOT do. 
  * this avoids repeating past known mistakes.
  * when effectively defined, this removes the fear of failure from the "manager"
* `Resources`
  * who the asignee can talk to (and their roles), 
  * the financial resources(hardware/software/office tools) , 
  * technical resources (information/data/knowledge base available), 
  * too many plans but without resources result in `FRUSTRATION`, see [So you want change? How to avoid confusion, anxiety, resistance, frustration and false starts.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/so-you-want-change-how-avoid-confusion-anxiety-false-starts-watling/)
* `Accountability` 
  * OKRs / Metrics against task delivery will be evaluated.
  * this tells us if the `Desired Results` has been achieved or how close we are now.
* `Consequences`
  * share what will happen if the task fails
    * people who understand the impact of the task on the big picture get [more involvement, meanining more commitment](https://lamountaincoaching.com/commitment/involvement-commitment/) 
    * [one of the top 10 ted talks of all time (by Simon Sinek)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA) also say that people are more commited to a cause when they understand the `WHY`
