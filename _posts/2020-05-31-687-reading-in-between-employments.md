<!-- wp:paragraph -->  <p>Whenever i move from one employer to another, I make sure to take a few weeks off to read.<br>So I will have new knowledge than i can potentially be a better person at the new job.<br><br>This gives me chance to detox (from the old Job) and catch up on all the books I've bought but haven't read yet.<br>This allows me to learn new things that i might be able to use to improve the way I work.</p>  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->    <!-- wp:quote -->  <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Don't just buy books, buy the time to read them too.</p></blockquote>  <!-- /wp:quote -->    <!-- wp:heading -->  <h2>This might be an expensive move, few weeks of unemployment. </h2>  <!-- /wp:heading -->    <!-- wp:paragraph -->  <p><br>But this means that to be able to do this, you should've already built healthy personal finance habits.<br>This basically means you should have an <strong>Emergency Fund</strong>. An Emergency fund is about 3-6 months worth of your living expenses. <br>Living expenses, not monthly salary. <br><br>There are many good reasons to have this which includes the ability to take weeks of rest when you resign from a job.<br>This also allows you to not be scared of losing your job, which means you won't be afraid to stand up for things you know are right.</p>  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->    <!-- wp:heading -->  <h2>No more summer vacations</h2>  <!-- /wp:heading -->    <!-- wp:paragraph -->  <p>Summer vacations end the moment we leave college.<br>its always nice to have one every few years.<br>I'm not recommending you have one every year though.<br>But in case you do get that chance, take that time to unwind and prepare properly for a new career ahead. <br>:)</p>  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
