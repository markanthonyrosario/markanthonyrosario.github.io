Information Systems are often abstract to programmers until they spend long enough time in the domain.</p>  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->    <!-- wp:paragraph -->  <p>My advice to circumvent that is to read business books and work closely with business people until you understand how the yout system works.</p>  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->    <!-- wp:paragraph -->  <p>..to be continued</p>  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->  <h3>Other Sources you can read</h3>  <!-- /wp:heading -->    <!-- wp:list -->  <ul><li><a href="https://www.oodesign.com/single-responsibility-principle.html">https://www.oodesign.com/single-responsibility-principle.html</a></li><li><a href="https://8thlight.com/blog/cory-foy/2012/08/07/thinking-differently-about-srp.html">https://8thlight.com/blog/cory-foy/2012/08/07/thinking-differently-about-srp.html</a></li></ul>  <!-- /wp:list -->
