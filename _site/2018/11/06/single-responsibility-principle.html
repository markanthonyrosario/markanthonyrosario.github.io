<p>This image is a perfect example why we need to adhere to SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).</p>

<p>Imagine how terrible would it be to have your elevator disabled due to a light switch that has tight coupling to the main functions of the elevator.</p>

<p>Examples like this are easy to understand because you know what exactly a lightbulb,what exactly an eleveator is and their differences/boundaries but when it comes to coding information systems (like a procurement system and a disbursement system) things get muddy because we dont know what they are, how they work and what their differences/boundaries are. Information Systems are often abstract to programmers until they spend long enough time in the domain.</p>

<p>My advice to circumvent that is to read business books and work closely with business people until you understand how the yout system works.</p>
